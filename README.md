# Hello! 👋 I'm PCgamerbom, but you can call me NOEL

I'm a self-taught web developer who loves learning day by day and turning knowledge into real things. I started programming out of curiosity, but now it’s something that truly motivates me to keep moving forward.

I've been exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — always aiming to build simple, functional, and creative websites. I'm still at the beginning of my journey, but each project is a new chance to improve and try something different.

I like to get my hands dirty, make mistakes, try again, and see things working in the end. My current goal is to gain experience and contribute to meaningful projects, like social impact websites or anything that helps others.
